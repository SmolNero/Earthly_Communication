# 🧠 Earthly Communication: An Emotional OS

**A slow tool for fast minds.**  
*Built in Rust. Written in parallel with the essay series on [smolnero.com](https://smolnero.com).*

---

**Earthly Communication** is a prototype emotional operating system — part logic-based journaling space, part intentional living assistant. It helps users track thoughts, process transitions, and prune what no longer serves. Like an OS for the self.

This project lives at the intersection of:

- 🌱 personal reflection  
- 🧩 system design  
- 🔧 emotional debugging

Each module pairs with an essay in the *Detached Observation* series — the code and writing grow together.

## 🛠️ Current Focus

We're in early construction. The first component — `tracker.rs` — centers around intention mapping and phase detection.

Planned modules include:

- `memory_pool` – track emotionally retained states  
- `pruner` – remove outdated belief patterns  
- `scheduler` – structure aligned routines  
- `evaluator` – check thought impact over time

Think: an emotional OS that doesn't *fix* you — it *lets you reflect*, system by system.

## 👤 Who It's For

- Writers, philosophers, and builders of inner systems  
- Developers exploring code as metaphor  
- People recovering from burnout, identity fatigue, or hyper-connectivity  
- Anyone who wants to slow down and build their life with intention

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust gives us the memory safety, modularity, and clarity needed to mirror emotional processes. It forces structure — and sometimes that’s the kindest design.
